# bem_emf_b1
This is the electromagnetic field analysis program for arbitrary objects irradiated by arbitrary beams. This is based on boundary element method, the numerical solution is used my own developed method. This is the full vector field analysis, the corner probrem free. Intel Math Kernel Lirbrary is required. Gmsh is used to create mesh data of object. The electromagnetic field analysis program "multi_fbeam" is used to analyze incident field. 

## Usage of example code
